# Kernel module
The kernel module blocks malicious network packets and writes to a log file.
The module handles only incoming traffic. The processing function finds TCP packets, identifies in the data field whether the HTTP request is a GET request, and if it is, checks whether the packet contains a previously defined signature.
Install
```
sudo insmod module_kernel.ko
```

sudo dmesg
